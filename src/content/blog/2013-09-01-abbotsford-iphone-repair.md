<div><br></div>Just sitting at Tim Hortons on Sumas way in Abbotsford repairing iPhones this morning.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>My first one was a 4S with a broken screen for an Abbotsford drummer. His band is going on Tour tomorrow and needed his phone fix ASAP.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The second one was a back glass I replaced for the Daugter of a retuning customer from Aldergrove. I had repaired his phone 2 years ago.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>My third one was the main speaker on an iPhone 4S for a Hope resident. This is my second faulty speaker on a 4S this week. The speaker had just stopped working.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>My 4th one, was for a couple from Chilliwack where one of their iPhone was acting up a bit. The power button was not working, one of the microphones was not working when recording video or when the phone was on speakerphone. My over-the-phone diagnostic was a faulty power button ribbon and I was almost right. The ribbon had gotten loose and was no longer connected to the motherboard. Probably after being dropped one too many times. I reconnected it and the phone was back to its original working condition.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhDDceBDcRM8OrCRucPn2EzKpYCCeiZohirOksLAvC3dFXMIVeCghDvQI9yRdxK3gSmKmyK_1ow9v6DE0D4z50hI4TzUZlsSiID2TsD0NGHNU-ShHVPwLnrOcJWCa8sr7B7x89Utw/s640/blogger-image-1328758220.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhDDceBDcRM8OrCRucPn2EzKpYCCeiZohirOksLAvC3dFXMIVeCghDvQI9yRdxK3gSmKmyK_1ow9v6DE0D4z50hI4TzUZlsSiID2TsD0NGHNU-ShHVPwLnrOcJWCa8sr7B7x89Utw/s640/blogger-image-1328758220.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKgLDCNsyTXnF8VTd_T1_OCqKDtCQUo5fF9rNgqV0_j40iC_Pb_N1wRGPc_ViP062OaFDXz8QycSRRc9UIu_Ccw-c6IobwWz1B2U__gQ6K3T8NFyVG99W_5wtfW8gaRAvDm6wGxw/s640/blogger-image-372006817.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKgLDCNsyTXnF8VTd_T1_OCqKDtCQUo5fF9rNgqV0_j40iC_Pb_N1wRGPc_ViP062OaFDXz8QycSRRc9UIu_Ccw-c6IobwWz1B2U__gQ6K3T8NFyVG99W_5wtfW8gaRAvDm6wGxw/s640/blogger-image-372006817.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiuAbg81GdiA2U26An5vJA8yVWzKpE2-gK9ZW3Mkh-7DsmxVjWFjpAMypqQ7JY7FgJ3zQ7LZrr3f0q25ZloV6lCLEv_9o6SmrSSN_DDAgw4NX8MspUOgOIVIug_tDsYHIOXr1VnPg/s640/blogger-image--2058640620.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiuAbg81GdiA2U26An5vJA8yVWzKpE2-gK9ZW3Mkh-7DsmxVjWFjpAMypqQ7JY7FgJ3zQ7LZrr3f0q25ZloV6lCLEv_9o6SmrSSN_DDAgw4NX8MspUOgOIVIug_tDsYHIOXr1VnPg/s640/blogger-image--2058640620.jpg"></a></div><br></div></div></div></div></div>
