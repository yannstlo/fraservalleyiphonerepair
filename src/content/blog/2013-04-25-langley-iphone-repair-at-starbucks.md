Here is one of the phone I had to repair this evening. I spent a few hours at Starbucks on 200th near Highway 1 to repair a few iPhones. The first one was a Black iPhone 4S with a broken front and back glass, the second was a White 4S that needed a new back, the 3rd was an iPhone 4 that required a new home button. My last one was another White 4S this one needed a new front screen. The last one was a referral from <a href="https://www.apexwireless.ca/" target="_blank">Apex Wireless</a>&nbsp;in Langley. All customers were able to watch while I performed the repairs except for the last one who dropped her phone off on a way to her sports team practice. I dropped the phone off to her after the repair was complete.<br />
