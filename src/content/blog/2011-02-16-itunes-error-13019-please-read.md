The error number in iTunes was 13019. I Googled the issue and found this article in apple's knowledge base.&nbsp;<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2830">http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2830</a><br />
<br />
Well after a few hours of troubleshooting and following the article's suggestion I called Apple. The technicians were very nice and helpful as usual and proceeded to tell me to uninstall and reinstall iTunes following&nbsp;these&nbsp;directions:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1923">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1923</a>&nbsp;and asked me to call back if it does not solve the issue and they would send me a new phone.<br />
<br />
After no success with the iTunes uninstall and reinstall I decided to look online again. I ended up finding another post identical to the first one on this site:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.errorbank.com/apple/itunes/how-can-i-fix-the-itunes-error-13019-when-i-sync/">http://www.errorbank.com/apple/itunes/how-can-i-fix-the-itunes-error-13019-when-i-sync/</a><br />
<br />
I noticed that I had skipped a crucial step, both articles stated that I should "<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">check the <b><u>device</u></b> and the iTunes library for duplicate voice memos. If you find any duplicate voice memos</span>". I had not looked on my phone and there was the problem&nbsp;staring&nbsp;at me. I had many duplicates of voice memos. I proceeded to delete all of them and then sync, Et Voila!<br />
<br />
I hope I'll save someone some time as I could have saved al lot of time by reading the first article properly.
