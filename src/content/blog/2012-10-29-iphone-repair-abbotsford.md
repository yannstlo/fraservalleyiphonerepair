Abbotsford is certainly the largest city in the Fraser Valley and where &nbsp;I perform most of my repairs. I have hundreds of happy iPhone owners who had their devices repaired through Fraser Valley iPhone Repair. Thanks to all of you.<br />
<br />
iPhone repair is not the only service provided. I have become very proficient with iPad and iPod Touch repair. With more and more iOS devices coming to the market, I will continue to extend my offerings.<br />
<br />
The iPad mini will soon be on the repair list as well as the iPod Touch 5th Gen. Do not hesitate to contact me for any services not advertised on the service page.<br />
<br />
I look forward to serve you soon.<br />
<br />
