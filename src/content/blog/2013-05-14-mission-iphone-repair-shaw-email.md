I repaired a couple of phones tonight. 1 was a Black iPhone 4 where the customer, a young guy, wanted to switch his front from black to white. He kept the back black and the home button black. It gave the iPhone a pretty cool look. Yin & Yang Style...&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The other iPhone was an older 3GS (Yes, i still repair those, second one this &nbsp; week) which I was repairing for its second time. The owner likes to be contract free and did not mind to put a bit more money into it. I gave him a freebie by reconfiguring his Shaw Email Account from using the old pop3 protocol to the newly supported EAS (Microsoft Exchange Active Sync) protocol. This is certainly the best you can get if you are using a Shaw Account on your iPhone. He can now Sync his Mail, Contacts, Calendars and Reminders which will also ensure that he is 100% backed up.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgIOsSCA0UVbhYYxtNZjNTPs6g6Qprwkx9PR_Zft1yeGLo0NiD9poLyBDA5eAEiyAcRKlTGXgsiTcAqRHtNvgX5-abumFN_9VmRSEH83s4_G-7moVi-ifPoQsC59YthteUBEsU4wg/s640/blogger-image-861264424.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgIOsSCA0UVbhYYxtNZjNTPs6g6Qprwkx9PR_Zft1yeGLo0NiD9poLyBDA5eAEiyAcRKlTGXgsiTcAqRHtNvgX5-abumFN_9VmRSEH83s4_G-7moVi-ifPoQsC59YthteUBEsU4wg/s640/blogger-image-861264424.jpg"></a></div>
