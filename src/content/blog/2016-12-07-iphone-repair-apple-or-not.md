I get many many calls from customers looking to get their iPhones repaired who are shopping around for the best price in town.<br />
<br />
Well, the best price in town could be Apple.<br />
<br />
Here is why you want me to fix your phone or why you want Apple to do it.<br />
<br />
On an iPhone 6S, an iPhone 7, an iPhone 6 plus, an iPhone 6S plus or an iPhone 7 plus, apple is cheaper... hands down. As long as it is only a screen repair and you don't have water damage or any other reason for them to push you to the "SCREEN AND ADDITIONAL DAMAGE" option, you are better off with them.<br />
<br />
An other advantage with Apple, you'll retain your warranty if you have any left. I void warranties!!!<br />
<br />
Now, to the convenience factor (:<br />
<br />
- I have the parts on hand and you don't need a "GENIUS BAR" appointment...<br />
- You don't need to drive to Gilford Mall in Surrey or Coquitlam Center.<br />
- I do all my repairs right before your eyes, not in the back of a store where you have no clue what is going on with your phone that has all your personal life on it... like some other shops.<br />
-Warranty; if you are out of warranty, you have nothing to loose. I use original parts and warranty my work to my customers' satisfaction. I'm not happy until you are.<br />
<br />
Here is what Apple Canada Charges as of Dec 6, 2016...<br />
