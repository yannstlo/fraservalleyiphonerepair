Just completed an iPhone 4S screen repair for a Mission resident. She looked terrified when I started taking it apart but warmed up when it started coming back together. She was very happy with the repair.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Her phone was in an OtterBox when she dropped it but case was not able to prevent the screen from breaking. Here is a photo before the repair.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEizPmfPckqmoWqOBGj9-FWsmhgi2FlWHvBiYsanJH5LlM5T_DCxyI9wXgpS-wruaEJc-FzQLK773K4dDa8n6Tv-kXK3gh81QDma94ZpyuNXtVAXqgw82ZGdtFPASZcDjeydEhwOCg/s640/blogger-image-1645365249.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEizPmfPckqmoWqOBGj9-FWsmhgi2FlWHvBiYsanJH5LlM5T_DCxyI9wXgpS-wruaEJc-FzQLK773K4dDa8n6Tv-kXK3gh81QDma94ZpyuNXtVAXqgw82ZGdtFPASZcDjeydEhwOCg/s640/blogger-image-1645365249.jpg"></a></div><br></div>
