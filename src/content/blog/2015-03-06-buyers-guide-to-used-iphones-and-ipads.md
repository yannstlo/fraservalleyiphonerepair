There has been an increase in the number of support calls I receive from people purchasing second hand iPhones and iPads who find themselves unable to use their new devices.<br />
<br />
Apple's iCloud Activation System is requesting the password from the previous owner in order to activate the device and the new owner is completely unaware of this information and unable to get help from the seller.<br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
To give you a bit of background on the new security measures that were put in place by device makers like Apple and associations like the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association (CWTA) in Canada. These new measures help ensure that devices that are lost or stolen can find their way back to their original owner or become unusable by the party who finds the lost device.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
In the case of the Apple devices like the iPhones and iPads, it is now easy to protect your device by simply turning on the "Find My iPhone" setting under the iCloud setting panel.&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association has also helped curved down the number of stolen devices in Canada by allowing to report your lost or stolen device to your cell phone carrier. The device will be placed on the list of devices that can no longer be activated in Canada. This is where shoppers for used devices need to be extra careful.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Many unscrupulous person might try to resell devices that were acquired through nefarious channels. BE CAREFUL !</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Here are a few tips to consider before buying a used device:</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
1. Is the seller the original owner? Does he have the receipt proving ownership or even the original box?<br />
<br /></div>
<div>
2. Check Apple's Web Site to see if the device is under iCloud Activation Lock via the following URL:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icloud.com/activationlock/" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">https://www.icloud.com/activationlock/</a><br />
<br /></div>
<div>
Activation lock verification should be done from a desktop browser. You will also need to provide the EMEI or Serial Number of the device. Ensure you are getting this number from the device itself. Don't let the seller give you a number over the phone or in an email... They could give you a totally different number.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
3. Check the&nbsp;<span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association web site to ensure the device has not been flagged there.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
4. If the device is at the setup screen, Ensure you can get through the entire setup. You will need a SIM Card for the corresponding carrier (Most iPhone are lock to a particular carrier).</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
You will also need access to 3G/LTE or Wifi Network for the iPhone to reach Apple's server and verify that the device can be Activated.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
In this step, you do not need to enter your Apple ID or to pick a Password, you can always redo these steps later by erasing the device and setting it up after you know it is good to go.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>

<div>
5. If the device is already activated and has not been erased, ask its owner to erase it prior to purchasing. Prior to erasing it, ensure they turn off find my iPhone.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
</div>
<div>
6. If you have acquired a device from a friend or family member and they forgot to deactivate Find My iPhone prior to handing you the device, they can also login to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icloud.com/iphone_welcome/">https://www.icloud.com</a>&nbsp; using their Apple ID and remove the device from their list of devices. This is easier and more secure than asking them to give you their password. This should also be done from a desktop browser.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
If you follow these few tips, I can't guarantee that crooks won't get you but it should save you from the majority. One tip I always give people when buying used devices is that you must trust the person you are buying the phone from 100%. Used phones can have so many issues.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
- Water damages</div>
<div>
- Bad batteries</div>
<div>
- They were repaired by non-experienced technicians using sub-par parts</div>
<div>
- Faulty hardware, wifi, camera, speaker, microphone, buttons, etc.</div>
<div>
<br />
I hope these few tips will at least help 1 of you out there looking for a used iPhone or iPad.</div>
