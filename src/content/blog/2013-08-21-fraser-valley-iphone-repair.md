Just completed my 3rd repair this evening.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The first phone I had to repair was in Abbotsford. I met the iphone owner at the Seven Oaks Shopping Center to replace a temperamental home button and an aging battery on his iphone 4.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>After the repair was completed I headed into Mission to replace the charging dock on an iPhone 4. The dock connector was physically broken and would no longer take a charge. The dock connector was quickly replaced and the phone was again taking a charge.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br></div><div>My last repair was just 1<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">5 minutes&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">outside of mission in an area called Hatzik. The iPhone 4S had a smashed screen (see image below) and was starting to loose glass pieces. I installed a new screen for the owner, he was very happy as his only other option was Telus or Apple asking $200.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6ncgMd17d4CkjfG5VtAt8qwROAMN8En-GvXWLuEc8SE0MkGjOSXeOXDHJaybQTYKyp4FQ3EXY6ToOcWCvuZCSdVV7PzcQOXkAyKLy69T7dQ2K5N2mAW6fEAm2LHT8TQZqgc-PQQ/s640/blogger-image--1321803602.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6ncgMd17d4CkjfG5VtAt8qwROAMN8En-GvXWLuEc8SE0MkGjOSXeOXDHJaybQTYKyp4FQ3EXY6ToOcWCvuZCSdVV7PzcQOXkAyKLy69T7dQ2K5N2mAW6fEAm2LHT8TQZqgc-PQQ/s640/blogger-image--1321803602.jpg"></a></div><br></span></div>
