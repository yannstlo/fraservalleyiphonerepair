Just replaced the battery on an iPhone 4 for a customer who recently purchased the phone on Craigslist. The phone had previously been repaired and customized by it's previous owner as the metal frame was black just like the iPhone 5. <br />
<br />
The previous owner had also left the power button / proximity sensor unplugged or it gotten loose since the new owner purchased it. All and all, be careful when buying iPhone on Craigslist. <br />
