<p>&nbsp;I haven’t had to repair many iPhone XS Max but I recently had a customer with a broken front screen and back screen requiring a new lease on life. The front screen is no problem but I do not repair the back glass at this time. Here is a nice little work around though and my recommendation at this time. Even as an iPhone repair shop, my recommendation is to get a nice case that will cover the back screen. YouTube is full of videos of people replacing the back glass and it is no small feat.</p>
<p>Hope this helps &nbsp;</p>
