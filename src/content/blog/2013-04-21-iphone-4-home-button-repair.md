Here is a picture of a broken home button (the one on the right) and next to it a new one... Can you spot the problem? Over time the silver circle often shifts and this is why your home button starts acting up and is not always as responsive as it should. It usually starts by being an intermittent problem to the point where it just won't work. Not too worry, it's an easy fix. Just give me a call! <br/><br/><div class="separator"style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwCuAphUPjq4xp2wfFvonN5K1msx_OOKYyFe8-r-3K2BTI_Y7D8RjibsouSTgv9P4H3aR8dsp6UeQbc_5KTxgW3IZdYlcxBU2J01-aAp342e0g8egE_MAKXIP9IrZ1glXubSgcWw/s640/blogger-image--875323766.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwCuAphUPjq4xp2wfFvonN5K1msx_OOKYyFe8-r-3K2BTI_Y7D8RjibsouSTgv9P4H3aR8dsp6UeQbc_5KTxgW3IZdYlcxBU2J01-aAp342e0g8egE_MAKXIP9IrZ1glXubSgcWw/s640/blogger-image--875323766.jpg" /></a></div>
