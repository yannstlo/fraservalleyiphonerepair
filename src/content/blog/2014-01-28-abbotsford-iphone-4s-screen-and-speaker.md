I had a customer send me a picture of their phone today...<br />
<br />
It was apparent that the LCD had sustained damage and would require to be replaced.<br />
After exchanging a few text messages they also pointed out that the ear speaker was very low and that you could barely hear the person on the other end of a phone call.<br />
<br />
The ear speaker issue is very common and is often related to the mesh grill getting dirty and preventing the sound from coming through. I quoted the customer on replacing the screen and the speaker just to be on the safe side but as I had expected, replacing the screen which also includes a brand new mesh grill also solved the sound dampening issue.<br />
<br />
If you think the sound in the ear speaker of your iphone is lower than it use to be, you can try cleaning it form the outside but if that doesn't solve the issue, give me a call and I can start by replacing the mesh grill on your phone.<br />
