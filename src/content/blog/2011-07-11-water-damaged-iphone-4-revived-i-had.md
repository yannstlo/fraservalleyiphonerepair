I had an interesting service call last week. A new customer called me after his iPhone 4 had entered a hot tub and was no longer turning on.&nbsp;The phone would get as far as the plug into iTunes screen when connected to a wall outlet but the second you unplugged it, it would die. Hooking it up to a computer was not providing enough power for it so it would not even turn on. In a last effort to troubleshoot the issue, which I thought was a lost cause, I replaced the phone's battery. To my surprise, the phone turned on. I was still very&nbsp;skeptical&nbsp;that all components would still be functional but yes, they were. We poked around and the&nbsp;WiFi,&nbsp;Bluetooth, speakers, proximity sensors and microphones were all working. The phone, except for its battery had survived the plunge.<br />
<br />
Note: As a lot of online post suggest, the owner of the phone had placed his phone into rice for a few days before calling me to help rescue his it. The water that had been inside the iPhone had completely evaporated and as this story shows, probably helped quite a bit.
