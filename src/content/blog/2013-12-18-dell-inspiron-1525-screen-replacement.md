I was recently asked by a customer if I could repair laptops. I replied that I do some repair from time to time but I do not advertise the service and do not keep replacement parts on hand. He proceeded to show me his daughter's laptop that for which the screen had been broken for a couple years now and was now sitting in a closet. The laptop was not the latest and greatest but was worth saving rather than buying a new one.<br />
<br />
After getting a quote from Dell for the replacement LCD, the customer confirmed that he was ok with buying the part and paying me for the installation.<br />
<br />
The installation process is not the most complicated but if you've never done one, it's easy for something to go wrong or for little parts to break.<br />
<br />
I was able to find a very nice service manual on Dell's website that walked me through the disassembly process. The LCD was the correct part and it went in without issues. I could have save a few bucks by scouring the internet for an aftermarket LCD but when you buy it from the manufacturer, you know it will fit without any doubts.<br />
<br />
Here are before and after shots of the laptop .<br />
