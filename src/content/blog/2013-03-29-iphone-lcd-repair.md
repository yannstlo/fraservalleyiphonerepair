Replace the screen on an iPhone 4S today where the LCD stopped working after the phone was left in a car at -30 Celsius. The screen had been broken for several weeks which didn't prevent the owner from using the phone but once the LCD had gone black, they had to get it repaired. The $180 insurance they had purchased with the phone wanted another $180 to replaced the phone... Wow! <br/><br/><div class="separator"style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi_B5a1vcSh-sIHvso_ZBw9fGCRFAzVsu3TLBlVxPie6vquZG4b1ixKlCU8yNA6d4NJ6tC4v5bebBe9YU75qKoiVvdZpjWO4yYysaAtnIpgd0jUMGBMFSuU21FbuEkkAYNHZEeCPw/s640/blogger-image-1286392706.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi_B5a1vcSh-sIHvso_ZBw9fGCRFAzVsu3TLBlVxPie6vquZG4b1ixKlCU8yNA6d4NJ6tC4v5bebBe9YU75qKoiVvdZpjWO4yYysaAtnIpgd0jUMGBMFSuU21FbuEkkAYNHZEeCPw/s640/blogger-image-1286392706.jpg" /></a></div>
