Unfortunately, back in December 2012, Google had announce they would no longer support the Microsoft technology and require that users start using imap for mail, CalDAV for calendar and CardDAV for contacts.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Any devices that were currently using Active Sync on your at the time of the announcement were grandfathered and would not need to switch until a new device was activated on your account.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I stopped by the Apple store in Mississauga, Ontario a couple weeks ago after noticing some dust between the back camera and the lens. The dust was so bad that I could see it when taking pictures. Knowing how good Apple is with their customer support I expected nothing less than a new phone, and they came true. They tried to clean it a first but actually made it worse. The employee wanted me to book an appointment with the "genius" but as I was traveling through the area, they agreed to do it on the spot as long as I accepted to wait for an opening.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Since I had my MacBook Pro with me, it was not going to be a problem to backup and restore the phone while on my travel. I wasn't even done backing up my old phone that i was presented with a new phone by an Apple Store employee. I completed the backup process and then started to restore onto my new phone. Then it hit me! I realised that I would no longer get active sync to function for my Gmail Account and my 2 Google Apps Accounts. I was bit worried as I had not</div><div>really used the IMAP, CalDAV and CardDAV technology from Google elsewhere then on my Mac. I was so used to EAS that I was no looking forward to the change.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I did a few Google Search to find all the info required to set it up. It was a bit more work to setup than EAS but after 2 weeks using it, I can say that I see much difference. I'm usually the first one to embrace changes and new technologies and now that's it done, I really have nothing to complain about.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here is a link that itself, links to the instructions for Email, Calendar and Contact Sync setup.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/3008051?hl=en">https://support.google.com/mail/answer/3008051?hl=en</a></div><div><br></div><div>I hope this was helpful.&nbsp;</div>
