Since the iPhone 6 release in September 2014, their user base has continued to grow steadily. All Canadians stuck in their iPhone 4 - 3 year contract are finally off the hook and able to purchased the newer, faster, slicker and bigger phone. The newer 6 and 6 plus are just as vulnerable to breakage as their older counterpart. I personally find them the most slippery of all iPhones and for my first time, &nbsp;I started using a case.<br />
