Sometimes, the damage also affects the LCD display, causing color lines to show up on the screen. This makes the phone hard or impossible to use.</p><p><br /></p><p>That was the case for one of my customers who brought me their iPhone 11 with a broken screen and LCD. They had dropped their phone and the impact had cracked the glass and ruined the display. They needed me to fix it fast, as they relied on their phone for work and personal use.</p><p><br /></p><p>I told them that I could replace the screen and LCD in less than an hour, using high-quality parts and tools. I explained the steps of the repair process and gave them a quote. They agreed to the price and handed me their phone.</p><p><br /></p><p>The first step was to remove the two screws at the bottom of the phone and use a suction cup and a spudger to pry open the display from the phone. I was careful not to damage any of the cables or connectors inside.</p><p><br /></p><p>The next step was to disconnect the battery and then the display from the logic board. I also removed the earpiece speaker and front camera from the old display.</p><p><br /></p><p>The third step was to transfer the earpiece speaker and front camera to the new display.</p><p><br /></p><p>The final step was to reconnect the display and battery to the logic board and then close up the phone by snapping the display back into place. I also replaced the two screws at the bottom of the phone.</p><p><br /></p><p>I turned on the phone and tested it. Everything worked great. The new screen and LCD were bright and clear, with no lines or distortions. The touch response was smooth and accurate. The earpiece speaker, front camera and Face ID were also working fine.</p><p><br /></p><p>I showed the phone to my customer and they were very happy with it. They thanked me for my quick and professional service and paid me. They also left me a positive review on my website.</p><p><br /></p><p>I was happy that I could help them fix their iPhone 11 screen and LCD in less than an hour. It was a satisfying and rewarding experience for me as an iPhone repair technician. If you have a broken iPhone screen or LCD, contact me for a fast and reliable service.&nbsp;</p>
