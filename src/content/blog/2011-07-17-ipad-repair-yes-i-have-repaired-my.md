<br />
Yes, I have repaired my first iPad First Gen this week. After repairing iPhones for the last year, it was only a matter of time before someone would ask me to repair their iPad even after I warned them I had never repaired one before. The iPad owner was my boss' friend who I had previously repaired his 3GS' Digitizer. He&nbsp;(or should I say a family member)&nbsp;had packed the iPad in their cosmetic bag and one of the cream bottle had leaked. The iPad was still working but would no longer charge.<br />
<br />
Cracking it open was a bit of a challenge and very similar to opening an iPod. There are 14 small metal clips around 3 of the sides. I managed to break 10 of them... Thankfully those clips are replaceable. Once open, we quickly realized that the cream had&nbsp;seeped&nbsp;in near the dock connector. I remove the dock connector assembly and Craig (my boss' brother who was assisting with the repair) cleaned it with "White Gas". This is the stuff used in Coleman Stoves. I was not sure about using this on electronics but Craig was confident it would be fine as it would try instantly.<br />
<br />
We&nbsp;reassembled the iPad for testing and the "White Gas" cleaning solution had done it. We could have used something else to clean it and I would not recommend the product for electronic cleaning but it had worked. We put the iPad back together with the 4 clips that were left and ordered a new set of 14 to be installed once received.<br />
<br />
The iPad was fixed!<br />

I did learn quiet a bit from the experience and might consider adding the iPad to the list of devices that I repair. I will need to fix a few more before I can actually charge for the work as I am still learning.
