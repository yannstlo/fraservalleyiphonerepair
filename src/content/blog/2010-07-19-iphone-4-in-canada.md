Well, only 12 Days until Canada and a few other countries get their change to purchase the iPhone 4. I know about all the bad press the antenna has been getting but it will not slow me down, there are enough other features and improvement to make it worth the upgrade.<br />
<br />
I guess will find out real soon if the issues are partly related to AT&T.<br />
See you on the other side.
