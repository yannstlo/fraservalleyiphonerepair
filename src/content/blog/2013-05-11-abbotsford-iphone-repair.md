Just completed the second repair for customer on his iPhone 4S. I had replaced the screen just over a year ago and this time the phone had fallen off of a roof, a 20 Foot drop. The LifeProof case helped break the fall but the screen was still smashed. Lets hope he has better luck with this one. Not that I don't like repeat customers but they usually don't like having to call me twice...<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJCFk4WS2BvWjCGc3M9Ra9lnuP-j54Rq-IM0FcZf3OCnArNs3_gocw4IqvARojVjCsDclNv6x8pVc2bY4zsQoh5YzMwa2XuwOyxTqgGVMJyBSFrjuJlTtSsMM5SZrRVjwTZCFGEg/s640/blogger-image-1529779565.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJCFk4WS2BvWjCGc3M9Ra9lnuP-j54Rq-IM0FcZf3OCnArNs3_gocw4IqvARojVjCsDclNv6x8pVc2bY4zsQoh5YzMwa2XuwOyxTqgGVMJyBSFrjuJlTtSsMM5SZrRVjwTZCFGEg/s640/blogger-image-1529779565.jpg"></a></div>
