Here is an iPhone 4S that was repaired tonight for a customer in Mission.<br />
<br />
The phone was unfortunately broken while the customer was on vacation in Mexico and as you can see from the image below, he was unable to use his phone for the rest of his trip.<br />
<br />
Repair was done in under an hour at the customer's home. Providing mobile service as well as evening and weekend service is a huge advantage for most people as they are working during the day and need to be home with their kids in the evening.<br />
