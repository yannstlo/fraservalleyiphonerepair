Since the iPhone 4S came out a few weeks ago, the demand for iPhone 3G has gone down&nbsp;tremendously. I have decided to run the following special to see if I can liquidate some of the 3G parts I have I have on hand.<br />
<br />
If you mention this offer when you call for service, I will offer your first part at no cost, yes FREE. All you pay is for the time it takes me to do the repair. my price have been the same since day one and I am not increasing the pricing to make up for the free parts. If you need 2 parts the most expensive one is FREE.<br />
<br />
Here are some of the pricing:<br />
<br />
iPhone 3G Digitizer: $50 installed (was $70)<br />
iPhone 3G LCD: $50 installed (was $85)<br />
iPhone 3G Battery: $50 installed (was $65)<br />
iPhone 3G Dock Connector: $50 Installed (was $70)<br />
<br />
These deals iPhone 3G DEALS are only valid on iPhone 3G phones while quantities last.<br />
Hurry up, it won't last.
