After replacing the screen assembly on an iPhone 5c over the weekend, the customer contacted me to report that her phone was not longer taking a charge. I reassured her that the work performed could not have caused the charging port to malfunction but that I would be happy to have another look at her phone and repair it if I could troubleshoot the issue.&nbsp;</div>

We met up tonight at a local Starbucks and proceeded to diagnose the problem. I used my own charger which I know works properly and when inserting it into the phone, it connected for a split second, then disconnected. If I held the cable pressed in, I was then able to make a connection. There was nothing inside the Lightning port and no visible damage in the area.</div>

The customer mentioned that when the phone was dropped and the screen broke, the phone had tumbled down a set of stairs. I figured the connector might have been pushed in by the fall and proceeded to loosen up the 4 screws that hold the connector inside the phone. I used a plastic spudger to push the lightning connector towards the bottom of the phone, screwed it back in ET VOILA!</div>

It seemed to be a mystery at first, how the charger had stopped working after the repair but I guess the customer had not tried or had the need to charge her phone after breaking it the day before. I was happy to help her and ensure her that my workmanship was not the root of the issue.&nbsp;</div>
