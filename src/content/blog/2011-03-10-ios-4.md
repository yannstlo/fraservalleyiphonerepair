<br />
Apple had announced last week at the iPad 2 reveal that the iOS Version 4.3 would be available on Friday the 11th but it is 10:44pm pacific time and I have just discovered that it is available... Downloading... The file is 669 MB. Let's hope I'll be up and running on iOS 4.3 before 11pm. Can wait to play with some of the new features. I know the wifi hotspot has been a heavily requested one. This will make a lot of iPad owner very happy as they can cut the cord on their iPad 3G bill.<br />
<br />
Thanks Apple for under&nbsp;promising&nbsp;and over delivering...
